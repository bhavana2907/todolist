# todolist
📚The Project is to build a TODO-LIST app that allows users to create to-do lists✅and add tasks to those lists.The app allows users to store their lists and task in a database,which enable them to view and manage their lists. Each list in the app can contain multiple cards, which represent individual tasks r items. Users can add due dates, checklists, and labels to each card to help them organize and prioritize their tasks. To build this app,I used a combination of technologies,including a database management system like MongoDB,a backend framework like Express and EJS template engine.The app allows users to add To-Do Tasks by filling in a form that requires the user to enter the Task,Category and DueDate.Once the user has entered the details and clicked the “ADD-TASK” button,it saves the data to the MongoDB database.We can observe the tasks that needed to be finished with deadline in mongo campus.Once if the user has finished a specific task ,user can select the tasks and press “DELETE-TASK”,then immediately the task will be deleted from the database.
